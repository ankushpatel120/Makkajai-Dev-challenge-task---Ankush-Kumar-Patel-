Hi Guys I have written the code using Java Language .
I have done Problem 1: Sales Tax
I also have added an extra value with the input for clarifying weather it is books, food,
or medical products and others .
If the product comes under anyone of them I add an extra character as n or else i add a extra character as y.
Eg: 1 imported box of chocolates at 10.00 n
    1 imported bottle of perfume at 47.50 y
